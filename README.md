  # 3D Tic Tac Toe Game

  Hello! I created this project as a part of my experimentation and learning of vibe-coding tools like Figma Make.

  This is a simple twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe where now you have to win spatially across the 3 layers.

  This is a code bundle for 3D Tic Tac Toe Game. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/okF1cKZss3NZUxd7AevclT/3D-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.

  Please feel free to fork it or suggest changes to merge so that we can make it even better.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
